# QR-Code-Generator
# QR Code Generator

The **QR Code Generator** is a Python script that empowers users to effortlessly generate QR codes for various purposes. QR codes, short for Quick Response codes, are two-dimensional barcodes that can store a wide range of information, including URLs, text, contact information, and more. This script leverages the `qrcode` library in conjunction with the `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) to produce QR codes with added customization options.

## Features

- **Customizable QR Codes:** The script allows users to customize their QR codes by specifying parameters such as size, error correction level, and adding a logo.
- **Error Correction:** Users can choose the error correction level to ensure the QR code remains scannable even if damaged or partially obscured.
- **Logo Integration:** Optionally, users can insert a logo or image into the center of the QR code, providing a visually appealing touch.
- **Batch QR Code Generation:** The script supports batch processing, enabling users to generate multiple QR codes consecutively.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** It offers a user-friendly command-line interface that guides users through the QR code creation process step by step.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.

```bash
python qr_code_generator.py
```

2. The script will prompt you to specify the number of QR codes you want to generate.

3. For each QR code, you will be asked to provide the following information:
   - The URL or text you want to encode in the QR code.
   - The desired output file name for the QR code image (e.g., qr_code.png).
   - The size of the QR code (default is 200 pixels).
   - Optionally, the path to a logo image to embed in the QR code (leave empty for no logo).

4. After providing the information, the script will generate the QR code and save it as the specified output file.

5. You can continue generating more QR codes or exit the script.
